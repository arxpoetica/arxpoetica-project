### Our Story

Arx Poetica is an intentional collective of artists connected through today’s online renaissance.

Like other art & culture movements of the past—everything from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance" target="_blank">the Renaissance</a>, to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment" target="_blank">the Enlightment</a>, to shorter-lived revivals like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyceum_movement" target="_blank">lyceum</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arts_and_Crafts_movement" target="_blank">Arts and Crafts</a> movements—Arx Poetica benefits from the technologies that make significant zeitgeists possible.

However, unlike past movements, Arx Poetica leverages the internet—as the media prophet Marshall McLuhan anticipated—to connect artists and innovators both locally and globally. To that end, Arx Poetica is a hub for local community meetups and participation, as well as a social media site for community building across the globe.

### Open Source “Slow-cial Media”

Arx Poetica is also an open source platform, born out of a desire to reclaim the essence of social media. Our guiding principle is to ride the momentum of three major waves of our time: Globalization, the Digital Revolution, and the Open Source Movement.

#### 1. Globalization

The world is in the midst of a global renaissance. Just as the printing press promoted the rapid spread of ideas, so too the internet promotes the rise of global content creativity and influence. To adapt a Pixar expression, “anyone can create.” Under the umbrella of Globalization, Arx Poetica aims to foster both global and local communities where a diverse range of artistic expressions can coexist.

#### 2. Digital Revolution

While the Digital Revolution has provided a magnificent tool in the form of the internet and modalities, Arx Poetica seeks to moderate its rapid pace. Our goal is to cultivate meaningful engagement through careful technical guidelines and restraints, aiming to restore the essence of “media” in social media. We elevate quality, thoughtfulness, and depth over mere speed and quantity.

#### 3. Open Source

Embracing the Open Source ethos, Arx Poetica encourages a variety of contributions—from software development, content creation, and idea brainstorming, to financial support. We believe that this collective effort and shared ownership are instrumental in shaping the future of our diverse artistic platform.

			preserves the identity of culture.
